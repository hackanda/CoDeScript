## Project to crop faces from several newspaper articles.

--> Yoo are given a zip file containing images of newspaper articles. Loop through all the articles in it , search for a particular keyword in all those articles.
    If found crop all the faces of persons in that articles and then print them as a single image.(One image for one article)
    
**You will need the knowledge of libraries like:**

1. **zipfile :** *reads the zipfile and used for working with files in it.*

2. **pytesseract :** *takes an image and performs OCR on that image to gather the text.*

3. **OpenCV :** *Computer Vision library to detect faces.*

4. **Pillow :** *Library to crop the faces , draw rectangels on them , creating new images*
    
--> Try it on your own first. If not getting any idea , you can have a headstart with my code that I have provided with this repo. If any any update you want to include you can ask for a pull request and you can upgrade the code however you like.

**All the files are already there in this repo . Try Working on it. Good Luck! :)**
