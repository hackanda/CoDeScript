# CoDeScRipt
## Project to crop faces from several newspaper articles.

--> Yoo are given a zip file containing images of newspaper articles. Loop through all the articles in it , search for a particular keyword in all those articles.
    If found crop all the faces of persons in that articles and then print them as a single image.(One image for one article)
    
**You will need the knowledge of libraries like:**

1. **zipfile :** *Reads the zipfile and used for working with files in it.*

2. **pytesseract :** *Takes an image and performs OCR on that image to gather the text.*

3. **OpenCV :** *Computer Vision library to detect faces.*

4. **Pillow :** *Library to crop the faces , draw rectangels on them , creating new images*

* Instructions
1. Clone this repo to your local  Computer using the clone button given at the right top corner.
2. Make sure all the files are in the same directory as we will be going to access them from our python project.
3. Open the Image_Project.py file in either your text editor or any IDE which can successfully run this python code. *(Jupyter Notebook Recommended)*
4. Finally, Just run this code and see what faces it can detect.
    
--> Try it on your own first. If you are not getting any idea , you can have a headstart with my code that I have provided with this repo. If any any update you want to include you can ask for a pull request and you can upgrade the code however you like.

--> To access the HTML file. Clone this repository to you local system and then open the HTML file through your browser.*(If you directly try to open it, It will show the HTML code and not the actual output)*

**All the files are already there in this repo . Try Working on it. Good Luck! :)**

## Bugs
* There are too many false positives in this method.
* The Overall Code takes a lot of time to execute even for a single Time.

**Any updation to the code is Welcome if it makes the code Better**
